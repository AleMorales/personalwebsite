# Biography

I am a postdoc working in plant modelling at the universities of Wageningen and Utrecht. My research interest include model-based statistical inference and plant ecophysiology, with an emphasis on the contributions of photosynthesis and morphology to plant growth. I am also a passionate programmer and I have developed several R and Julia packages. I am also a strong supporter of reproducible research.

My approach to research is to combine mathematical models with experiments in order to advance our knowledge of plant physiology. This has allowed to develop an unique set of skills and perspective, different from that of mathematicians and biologists: I am equally comfortable programming equations on the computer as taking measurements on plants. Most of my research has been done at Wageningen University & Research, though in the past I also work in Cordoba (Spain) and now I am also working at Utrecht University.
