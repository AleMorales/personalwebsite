# Biography

I am a postdoc working in plant modelling at the universities of Wageningen and Utrecht. My research interest include model-based statistical inference and plant ecophysiology, with an emphasis on the contributions of photosynthesis and morphology to plant growth. I am also a passionate programmer and I have developed several R and Julia packages. I am also a strong supporter of reproducible research.
