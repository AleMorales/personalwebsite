# Biography

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the universities of Wageningen and Utrecht. My skills include model-based statistical inference, scientific programming and process-based modelling as applied in Plant Sciences. I am an experienced R and Julia programmer with which I have built several [packages](https://github.com/alemorales).
