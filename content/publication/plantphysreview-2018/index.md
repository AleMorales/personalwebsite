abstract = "The environment of the natural world in which plants live and have evolved and within which photosynthesis operates is one characterized by change. The time scales over which change occurs can range from seconds (or less) all the way to the geological scale. All of these changes are relevant for understanding plants and the vegetation they create. In this update review, we will focus on how photosynthesis responds to fluctuations in irradiance with time constants up to the range of tens of minutes."

abstract_short = "Crops are regularly exposed to frequent irradiance fluctuations, which decrease their integrated COâ‚‚ assimilation and affect their phenotype."
